# gu-fall2019-dbms-project

Requires at least Node v10. After cloning the repository run `npm install` to install dependencies.

Run `node index.js` to start the web application server locally (deploys to localhost:5000).
Type `Ctrl + C` in terminal to stop server. You will need to stop and restart the server if you
make changes to any code.

Alternatively you can install Nodemon (via `npm install -g nodemon`) and then run `nodemon index.js`
which will hot-reload the server without needing to manually restart.

The project is deployed to gu-fall2019-dbms-project.herokuapp.com. Any pushes to this repository will
automatically deploy to Heroku.
